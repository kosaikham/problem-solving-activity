# Daily Problem Solving

This is my daily problem solving activity on [CodeWars.com](www.codewars.com) for fun using javascript.

**About Codewars**

[CodeWars](www.codewars.com) is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online IDE.
